# no-pain.nvim

This is a Neovim plugin that provides a highly customizable and visually appealing statusbar inspired by [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/). The plugin leverages the same logic as [mini.clue](https://github.com/siduck76/mini.clue) (similar to [which-key](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim)) to display contextual keybindings and modes in a clean and intuitive way.

## Features

- **Z Mode**: A mode inspired by Zellij's keybinding hints, providing a quick overview of available commands.
- **Insert Mode**: Displays relevant keybindings and information while in insert mode.
- **Builtin Completion Mode**: Shows suggestions and completions directly in the statusbar.
- **Register Mode**: Provides a quick view of available registers and their contents.
- **Windows Mode**: Displays keybindings and information related to window management.

## Installation

You can install this plugin using your favorite plugin manager. For example, using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):

```lua
use {
  'iodize13/no-pain',
  requires = { 'iodize13/no-pain' } -- or any other dependencies
}
```
